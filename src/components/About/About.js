        <ParagraphAbout>
          I am a software engineer with a focus on front-end development. In
          2022, I made the decision to leave my digital advertising career
          behind and embark on a journey of self-discovery. I soon uncovered a
          passion and aptitude for web developmentâ€”a path I had never previously
          considered. This revelation ignited my determination to dive headfirst
          into this dynamic field.
          {"  "}Since then, I've been contracting on exciting web projects while
          continuing to learn and grow, eager to take on new challenges and
          opportunities.
