        <ParagraphAbout>
        I am a self-taught software engineer with a focus on front-end development. 
        {/* <br></br> */}
        In 2022, I made the decision to leave my digital advertising career behind and embark on a journey of self-discovery. I soon uncovered a passion and aptitude for web developmentâ€”a path I had never previously considered. This revelation ignited my determination to dive headfirst into this dynamic field. 
        {/* <br></br> */}

        Since then, I've been contracting on exciting web projects while continuing to learn and grow, eager to take on new challenges and opportunities.

        {/* In 2022, I left my job in digital advertising and embarked on a journey of self discovery. Unsure where to begin, I started looking at my career in retrospect and taking inventory of the types of projects that made me tick, what I was naturally good at, and tasks that I genuinely enjoyed doing. After a few months of introspection, countless personality quizzes, and some introductory coding tutorials, I uncovered a passion and aptitude for web development - a path that i heretofore never considered.  */}
